						<p>Websites have become a must have for any small business. It's a tool that has been around for some time, but budgets, resources and ease of use have restricted them from becoming widely used. This has now changed - and recently a host of website builders have been made available to anyone who wants to build a site.</p>

						<p>The implications of a website are huge:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>a place to communicate directly to the public</li>
							<li>a platform to reconnect with existing customers</li>
							<li>to control some of the information that search engines receive</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>One of the main advantages of a website is the ability to provide up-to-date, relevant and accurate information. This information can be used by potential customers, existing customers and search engines to ensure that they know what you do, and how they can be part of it. It's important to make sure that it's easy to read and engages with your audience.</p>
						<p>Google has recently developed a Digital Garage to enable everyone to increase their online capacity. They have content on social media, websites, search engine optimisation (SEO), search advertising, and a range of great online tools. <a href="https://digitalgarage.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Become certified here.</a></p>

						<h2>Web Hosts vs Website Builders</h2>
						
						<p>There is often confusion surrounding the difference between a web host and a website builder. To put it simply, web hosts are like real estate agents who will sell you a block of land, it is then up for you to decide what to build on it, and who will build it. Website Builders are similar to renting a house; you are able to choose how to make it look, and have your own stuff in the 'house', but the structure and features will already be set.</p>
						<p>If you are just starting out, a free website builder probably the best way to go. They will give you a 'vanity URL' - something like yourwebsite.websitebuilder.com and space to store your content and images. You can always buy a domain name (yourwebsite.com) and have it point to your website (like mail redirection). As they are a free service, they may display ads on your site - and to get them removed, there's a small fee.</p>
						<p>If you are keen on DIY and are willing to build it yourself, find a web host and start playing around. There is a wide range of Content Management Systems (CMS) around and many are open-source, and therefore free. A CMS will provide background structure to the way your website works, but you are able to add all the features and functionality you want.</p>
						<p>If you go with a web host, you simply get what you pay for. There's an <a href="https://winningwp.com/shared-vs-managed-wordpress-hosting/" title="Shared vs. Managed Hosting" target="_blank">article here which outlines the differences between the variety of web hosting services available.</p>
