						<p>Social Networks are some of the world leaders in communication, and that means that it is important to get involved with them. Especially if you're wanting to reach both existing and new customers.</p>
						<p>Apart from simple mass communication, there are a variety of tools available to businesses to make the most of being online. Many of these are designed in particular for small business and community organisations.</p>
						<p>If you haven't set up a social media account yet, it's a good idea to work out what you want to achieve before getting started. If you've already set up an account, check out the tips below to make sure you're making the most of it.</p>

						<h2>Social Media Top Tips</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Use the network the way it's designed.</strong></p>
								<p>If you're on Instagram: post photos,  hashtags and tag accounts. If you're on Twitter, keep it short and engaging. Tag relevant hashtags. Facebook is appropriate for a lot of content, but it's good to make sure it's unique - try expanding on an Instagram post, or Tweet.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Include images, or even better, video.</strong></p>
								<p>This makes sure your post gets seen and stands out from the rest. Try out a free platform like Canva.com to create some good quality graphics and style your images.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Focus on what you're trying to say.</strong></p>
								<p>People don't like wading through paragraphs of information to possible arrive at a piece of information that could relate to a topic that they happened to be researching after deciding to read through a giant post on Facebook. (This is a case-in-point) It's important to remember who will read your content, and put it in a way that they understand.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Let people find out more.</strong></p>
								<p>One of the advantages of many networks is the possibility to easily link to external content - except for Instagram. Linking to more information is especially useful to analyse how people engage with your content through services such as Google Analytics (explained on the Websites page)</p>
